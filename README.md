## Toward 3D Hand Pose Estimation

### Introduction
This is a cs269 course project built on top of https://github.com/enghock1/Real-Time-2D-and-3D-Hand-Pose-Estimation
This repo contains implementation, training and evaluation of cos_loss_v1, cos_loss_v2 (Cosine Similarity Loss) and 
asm_loss (Active Shape Model Assisted Loss) done by Cheng Lu.

### Running the code
For installation, training and evaluation of our models, see ./hand_pose_estimation_train_evaluate.ipynb for details
